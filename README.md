# thermostat
This is a work in progress arduino based thermostat with the intention of becoming a smart thermostat.
The code is based off using a tmp36 temperature sensor. Data sheet can be found online. I decided to use software conversion for Farenheit readings at this point. I've also found that using the 3.3v as Vi gives a more accurate reading than 5.5v.
